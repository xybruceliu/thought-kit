This should expand their thinking with relevant concepts they might not have considered. For example, if they mention 'planning a trip to Japan', you might think 'Cherry blossom season (March-April), popular regions like Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka, Japan Rail Pass for transportation, onsen (hot springs) experiences, and basic Japanese phrases for travelers.' If they ask about 'learning Python', you might think 'Related concepts: object-oriented programming, popular libraries like Pandas and NumPy, project ideas like web scraping or data visualization, online learning resources like Codecademy or freeCodeCamp.'"
