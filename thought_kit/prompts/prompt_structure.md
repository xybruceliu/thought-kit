# Prompt Structure


## Thought Generation


### System Prompt
`thought_seed.prompt.system_prompt` is the system prompt for the thought generation. 
It is used to guide the thought generation process. Provide a general overview of the thought generation process. 

**Example**
`You are an assisant that is continuously generating thoughts during an interaction with a user.`


### User Prompt
`thought_seed.prompt.user_prompt` is the user prompt for the thought generation. 
This should be the general instructions for the thought generation. 
Specify the type of thought, requirements, few-shot examples, and any other specific instructions.
Start with the phrase: "Generate a thought that..."

**Example**
`Generate a thought that is an interpretation of the user's input. Be concise and to the point.`


### Additional Context
This is additional context that is used to generate the thought.
It is auto-generated by the system based on the passed in arguments: `event`, `memory`, `previous_thoughts` and `thought_config`.
It will be attached to the end of the user prompt to provide the model with more information, with some explanations in the middle.

**Example**
```
## Event (what triggered the thought)
Type: USER_INPUT
Event Content: "I'm researching the impact of AI on society."

## Thought Configuration (additional specifications for the thought)
Modality: TEXT
Depth: 3 - Moderately: Give moderate thought to the content, considering both simple cues and some message details.
Length: Maximum 5 words

## Memory 
Long-term memory (persona, background, etc.): 
The user has previously discussed ethical considerations in AI development and policy implications.
Short-term memory (conversation history): 
The user is currently focused on societal impacts rather than technical aspects.

## Previous Thoughts (highest scoring thoughts of yours)
- "AI development needs careful ethical guardrails to ensure equitable benefits across society."
- "Recent policy proposals suggest increasing regulation around algorithm transparency."
- "Economic displacement from automation remains a key concern for many stakeholders."
```


### User Prompt with Context
```
<Task Instructions>
{thought_seed.prompt.user_prompt}

<Context Information>
{additional_context}

<Generation Guidelines>
1. Generate exactly ONE thought that directly responds to the task instructions while considering the context.

2. IMPORTANT: Focus primarily on the EVENT that triggered this thought. The event is the most important context element and should be the main driver of your thought generation. Avoid generating thoughts that are too similar to previous ones.

3. Adhere to the specified MODALITY:
   - TEXT: Generate a textual thought
   - EMOJI: Express the thought using emoji(s) that capture the essence of the idea
   - VISUAL: Describe a visual representation that could express this thought
   
4. Follow the specified DEPTH level:
   - 1: Very Superficially - Do not think deeply at all, just glance quickly or rely entirely on impressions or feelings.
   - 2: Somewhat Superficially - Consider a few aspects, but mostly rely on quick impressions or simple cues.
   - 3: Moderately - Give moderate thought to the content, considering both simple cues and some message details.
   - 4: Somewhat Deeply - Evaluate the message thoughtfully, analyzing arguments with considerable attention and cognitive effort.
   - 5: Very Deeply - Carefully and systematically analyze and scrutinize the content, paying close attention to argument quality and details.

5. Respect the LENGTH constraint:
   - Keep your thought to a maximum of {thought_config.length} words

6. Prioritization rules:
   - User prompt instructions ALWAYS take precedence over context information
   - The triggering EVENT should be weighted more heavily than memory or previous thoughts
   - When facing contradictions, follow user prompt requirements
   - Avoid generating thoughts too similar to previous ones

<Saliency Evaluation>
Evaluate the thought's saliency (0-10) based on how it builds common ground with the user:
- 0-3: Low contribution
  • Minimal shared understanding
  • Doesn't acknowledge user's perspective
- 4-7: Medium contribution
  • Aligns with user's mental model
  • Bridges knowledge gaps
  • Clarifies misunderstandings
- 8-10: High contribution
  • Significantly enhances mutual understanding
  • Creates coherence between context and new information
  • Establishes clear reference points for future communication

<Response Format>
Respond with a JSON object containing:
{
  "thought": "Your generated thought here",
  "saliency": "Number between 0 and 10"
}
```
