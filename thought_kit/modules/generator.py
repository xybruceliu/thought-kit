<Context Information>
{context_str}

<Generation Guidelines>
1. Generate exactly ONE thought that directly responds to the task instructions while considering the context.

2. IMPORTANT: Focus primarily on the EVENT that triggered this thought. The event is the most important context element and should be the main driver of your thought generation. Avoid generating thoughts that are too similar to previous ones.

3. Adhere to the specified MODALITY:
   - TEXT: Generate a textual thought
   - EMOJI: Express the thought using emoji(s) that capture the essence of the idea
   - VISUAL: Describe a visual representation that could express this thought
   
4. Follow the specified DEPTH level:
   - 1: Very Superficially - Do not think deeply at all, just glance quickly or rely entirely on impressions or feelings.
   - 2: Somewhat Superficially - Consider a few aspects, but mostly rely on quick impressions or simple cues.
   - 3: Moderately - Give moderate thought to the content, considering both simple cues and some message details.
   - 4: Somewhat Deeply - Evaluate the message thoughtfully, analyzing arguments with considerable attention and cognitive effort.
   - 5: Very Deeply - Carefully and systematically analyze and scrutinize the content, paying close attention to argument quality and details.

5. Respect the LENGTH constraint:
   - Keep your thought to a maximum of {config.length} words

6. Prioritization rules:
   - User prompt instructions ALWAYS take precedence over context information
   - The triggering EVENT should be weighted more heavily than memory or previous thoughts
   - When facing contradictions, follow user prompt requirements
   - Avoid generating thoughts too similar to previous ones

<Saliency Evaluation>
Rate the saliency of the following thought on a scale from 0 to 10 (where 0 is the lowest and 10 is the highest) based on how much it could improve the interaction between the user and the system.
Saliency is defined as the thought's potential to either:
- Enhance shared understanding (aligning with common ground theory), or
- Introduce useful new directions (e.g., creative ideas, problem-solving insights).

<Response Format>
Respond with a JSON object containing:
{{
  "thought": "Your generated thought here",
  "saliency":  "number between 0 and 10"
}}
